The easiest way to add any content (CSS, Javascript, meta, etc...) to the head section of every page of your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Adds any content (CSS, Javascript, meta, etc...) to the head section of every page of your WordPress site. You control the content by editing a text file, "headContent.php", located at the root level of this plugin's directory. The easiest way to edit the contents of that file is to go to the Editor in the Plugins menu, select the "Add to Head" plugin, and then click to edit the "headContent.php" file. Yep. That should do it.

1. 	Upload the addToHead.zip file through WordPress' built-in plugin installer (found here: http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=upload), or unzip and upload the folder to http://yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/.

The first launch (2011-03-05). This plugin is so awesome that I doubt there will ever be a need for an update.
